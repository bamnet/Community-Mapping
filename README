== Community Mapping

The community mapping project provides a simple framework for collaborative map building.  Users can login 
and work on projects (aka maps) by creating layiners, adding points, or updating any of the related information.
Projects can be publicly viewable or restricted to approved collaborators only.  Each map contains a unique set
of layers which contains a unique set of points.  All this data can be expored via KML by anyone who can read the map.

== Quick Start

1. At the command prompt, type <tt>rake db:migrate</tt> to initialize the database.

2. Edit /config/enviroments/production.rb (or development if you're in that mode).
Change the localhost at the bottom to your hostname.  This will be used when new users
sign up to confirm there accounts.
i.e Change localhost in <tt>config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { :host => 'localhost' }</tt> to 'test.com'.

3. Visit your application in a web browser.

4. Click 'Sign Up' in the upper right, wait for the confirmation email, and enjoy!
